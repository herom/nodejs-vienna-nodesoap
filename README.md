This is an example application for my talk at the Node.js Vienna Meetup Group on October 14th, 2014. It is in no way
(feature) complete, styled or "production ready" and lacks of security checks and documentation. This application should
just give you a quick overview about what is possible with the `node-soap` libary [node-soap @ GitHub](https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap).

As of today (October 13th, 2014) this example app is working with the SOAP web service delivered by http://services.aonaware.com/DictService/DictService.asmx?WSDL
 (thanks for that :) ).
